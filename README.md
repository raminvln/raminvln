## Hi there ğŸ‘‹<!--
**raminvln/raminvln** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on nothing but my uni project.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning i hope everything.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with guidance.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: just this id on social medias.
- âš¡ Fun fact: time  is limited.
